# AI Knowledge Base üß†

An intelligent, full-stack application that transforms any PDF document into an interactive chatbot, allowing users to ask questions and receive context-aware answers. This project leverages a modern tech stack and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to provide accurate, AI-powered insights from your documents.

## ‚≠ê Key Features

* **Dynamic Knowledge Base:** Upload any PDF to create a new, queryable knowledge base on the fly.
* **Asynchronous Processing Pipeline:** Utilizes a robust backend queue system with **Redis** and **BullMQ** to handle document processing, text splitting, and vectorization as background jobs without blocking the user interface.
* **AI-Powered Q&A:** Employs **Google's Gemini models** (via LangChain.js) for both generating vector embeddings (`text-embedding-004`) and powering the conversational chat (`gemini-1.5-flash`).
* **Vector Similarity Search:** Performs efficient, real-time similarity searches using a **PostgreSQL** database supercharged with the `pgvector` extension to find the most relevant document chunks for any given question.
* **Modern, Responsive Frontend:** A beautiful and fully responsive user interface built with the **Next.js 14+ App Router**, styled with **Tailwind CSS**, and brought to life with components from **shadcn/ui** and animations from **Framer Motion**.
* **Full Document Management:** Includes complete CRUD (Create, Read, Delete) functionality, allowing users to manage their uploaded documents with individual and bulk delete options.
